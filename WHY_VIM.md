# Why Vim

### Pros:

 - Its inbuilt into unix operating systems so you can start immediately

 - Its super responsive and will load files faster than any other text editor (nearly every other text editor - less loads files faster, see `man less` for more info)

 - Using vim will speed up your typing

 - You will become more comfortable with using your terminal

 - Amazing shortcuts and commands

 - You will always be learning new ways to speed up your workflow

### Cons:

 - A modal editor is initially intimidating

 - Steep learning curve

 - The configuration can be time consuming to learn

 - Hard to pair and it can be difficult for another developer to use your setup
(I recommend using another editor for pairing)

_But_ To the cons I say: **Short term pain is worth long term gain.**
