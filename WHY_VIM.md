# Why Vim

Pros:

Its inbuilt into unix operating systems so you can start immediately

Its super responsive and will load files faster than any other text editor

Using vim will speed up your typing

You will become more comfortable with using your terminal

Amazing shortcuts and commands

You will always be learning new ways to speed up your workflow

Cons:

A modal editor is initially intimidating

Steep learning curve

The configuration can be time consuming to learn

Hard to pair and it can be difficult for another developer to use your setup
(I recommend using another editor for pairing)

_But_ To the cons I say: **Short term pain is worth long term gain.**
