# Why Vim

Vim is not for everyone, but if your looking to speed up your workflow longterm and enjoy learning new things.
I would consider learning it even if you don't use it as your primary text editor (or ide).

## Pros and Cons for using vim as your primary text editor

#### Pros:

 - Its inbuilt into unix operating systems so you can start immediately

 - Its super responsive and will load files faster than any other text editor (nearly every other text editor - less loads files faster, see `man less` for more info)

 - Using vim will speed up your typing

 - You will become more comfortable with using your terminal

 - Amazing shortcuts and commands

 - You will always be learning new ways to speed up your workflow
 
 - You will start to discover vim shortcuts built into all kinds of things
 
 - It puts you into a good mindset for improving your workflow

#### Cons:

 - The out of the box vim needs a little configuring

 - A modal editor is initially intimidating

 - Steep learning curve

 - The configuration can be time consuming to learn

 - Hard to pair and it can be difficult for another developer to use your setup
(I recommend using another editor for pairing)

_But_ To the cons I say: **Short term pain is worth long term gain.**

## But I like feature x which my text editor offers me which vim doesn't

Yes out of the box a lot of editors offer features which vim doesn't, but most features which I have seen offered by other text editors are actually available in vim as plugins. (Common complaints are the [file tree on the left](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) and colors).

## I've tried vim and I didn't like it...

Then perhaps vim isn't for you, but I think that most people give up too quickly.
You have to be aware that it will take a while to learn the shortcuts, the muscle memory and the mindset.
Some people also don't put in enough effort in continuously improving the way they work.
If you don't look at making your workflow faster and looking at new ways of doing things (either by researching it yourself or by pairing with someone who will teach you), then you won't be able to see the benefits that vim has to offer.

## Thoughts on vim plugins

I think people look to use vim plugins way too early so that they can get back to the familiarity of the mindset they had with their previous text editors instead of adopting the vim mindset.

I would recommend starting with as few plugins as possible and then slowly adding as few of them as possible and only the ones you need.

I feel that when you add a considerable amount of plugins you will hinder your vim learning and your long term workflow.

## So how long will it take to start to see the benefits of vim over my current text editor?

This is a rough guide for how long I think it would take for someone coming from a sublime or atom ide and learning vim from scratch:

* After one week you will be working painfully slowly and not be able to see how this editor could possibly be better and want to stop.
* After two weeks you will still be really slow, but start to like a couple of the shortcuts vim offers.
* After three weeks you will be a bit faster but suffering and will question if it would be worth learning all of these commands.
* After four weeks you will begin to use the vim resources (stack overflow, vim wiki and vim help) a little better and you will start to enjoy learning the new things vim has to offer (instead of thinking "not another command to learn").
* After five weeks you may have gained enough knowledge to enjoy using vim as much as your previous text editor and your workflow may be at a similar level

From now on you will probably see the benefits vim has to offer and can make the decision as to weather you should add a bunch of plugin customisations or to keep learning the vim way
